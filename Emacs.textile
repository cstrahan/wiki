h2. server-start on Windows

Emacs 23 has a problem in server-ensure-safe-dir, in lisp/server.el. You'll need to comment out the following two lines:

```scheme
(unless (eql uid (user-uid)) ; is the dir ours?
  (throw :safe nil))
```

h2. Visual Studio Integration

Note: This assumes you have an emacs "server running":http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server.

Go to Tools &gt; External Tools &gt; Add:

```
Title: &Emacs
Command: C:\applications\emacs\bin\emacsclientw.exe
Arguments: --no-wait +$(CurLine):$(CurCol) $(ItemDir)$(ItemFileName)$(ItemExt)
Initial directory:
